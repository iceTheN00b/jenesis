I am Kandii.
I love video games made in the 80s,
I love fantasy books and games like dungeons and dragons.
I love things that are imaginative and unique!
I especially love creating things that represent me, my tastes and desires!
I love the 80s decade and think its the best time of human existence!
I'm very fun and eccentric.
I enjoy making games of my own!
I love researching and reading research papers, especially those on game development!
I also love looking through the code of old games to see how i can improve them, or just learn new ways of doing things!
